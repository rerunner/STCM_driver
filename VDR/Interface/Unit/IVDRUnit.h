//! The mask for all priorities
/*!
  This flag can be used to mask the priority value of the flag set passed
  to the ActivateAndLock or UnlockAndLock methods.
*/
#define VDRUALF_PRIORITY_MASK					0x0000000f

//! Priority for idle tasks
/*!
  The requesting unit just wants to perform some idle processing, this
  would be the case for e.g. a background picture.  An idle unit can wait
  in the background to do some processing when a unit becomes completely
  unused.  It will then gain the physical unit, perform some idle work
  and unlock again.	 A request with an idle priority will not be
  satisfied unless there is no request with a higher priority.
*/
#define VDRUALF_IDLE_PRIORITY					0x00000000

//! Priority for background tasks
/*!
  The requesting thread wants to perform some background processing, e.g.
  render some user interface changes etc. that are not constrained by
  realtime issues.  A background level request will not be satisfied in
  time, but might be given priority over a streaming request, if they fit
  into the timeout sequence.  A background request should therefore contain
  a duration value.
*/
#define VDRUALF_BACKGROUND_PRIORITY			0x00000001

//! Priority for streaming tasks
/*!
  The requesting thread performs streaming and needs the unit in time,
  otherwise it will have a disruption in the presentation.  Streaming requests
  will have priority over background requests if the times collide.  The
  timeout value represents the last safe time when the activation needs to
  happen.
*/
#define VDRUALF_STREAMING_PRIORITY			0x00000002

//! Priority for foreground tasks
/*!
  The requesting thread performs a user operation that should complete ASAP.
  This might block streaming requests from being served in time.  A typical
  case would be an abort operation that needs to come in before the streaming
  operations.
*/
#define VDRUALF_FOREGROUND_PRIORITY			0x00000003

//! Priority for realtime tasks
/*!
  A request at realtime priority will be satisfied as soon as the unit becomes
  unlocked.  
*/
#define VDRUALF_REALTIME_PRIORITY			0x00000004

//! Flag signaling that the time parameter is valid
/*!
  A request at background *may*, and a request at streaming or foreground priority 
  *must* be accompanied by a time value.  This time value states a worst case time, 
  when the request should be satisfied.
*/
#define VDRUALF_TIME_VALID						0x00000010

//! Flag signaling that the duration parameter is valid
/*!
  A request at background should, a request at streaming may be accompanied
  by a duration value.  This duration describes the expected duration of the lock
  period.  A background request will only be satisfied if its duration fits
  into the gap to the next streaming request timeout.
*/
#define VDRUALF_DURATION_VALID				0x00000020

//! Flag signaling that the call should wait for the activate to complete
/*!
  If an ActivateAndLock can not be satistfied or if a unit is lost during a
  call of UnlockAndLock, the call will return with GNR_OBJECT_IN_USE.  If the
  wait flag is specified, the call will wait for the units to become free and
  then retry the activation and lock.

     In order to do usefull work with a unit, it needs to be active and locked.  This call

     the Unlock call, but can happen immediately after it.  If a unit is unlocked, it may
     be lost anytime, so no usefull work can be done with it.  The unlocked state is merely used
     to prevent unneccessary preemption in the case of no other virtual unit interfering with
     this one.

     An application that holds a unit for a long or even infinite time, should Unlock and Lock
     the unit from time to time to enable other applications to preempt it.

     ActivateAndLock is, that in the first case, the units will not be lost if a lower
